Single-family homes will also be in demand, as opposed to large multi-family buildings where isolation is nearly impossible. A quadruplex like it offers the possibility of distancing and isolation with a small group like an extended family or a group of friends—what we now call “confinement together”—and also creates economies of scale that you cannot achieve with the expenses of a single-family home.

  description: 'The house is a solid brick 7-unit multi-family in an up-and-coming neighborhood. We’re excited for Hayes partly because it has very attractive numbers up front, but also because most buildings in the neighborhood are undergoing renovations; we expect property values and rents to rise quickly in the area. Hayes will receive some renovations to help it realize its potential, too. As always, those renovations are already part of the token price and the expected yield.\nThe house is situated right next to a green park, and the area is very family-friendly. It offers a lot to like at a modest price point for lower-income tenants, and we expect it to get even better as the neighborhood flourishes!',

  description: 'This eight-unit, fully-rented multi-family features a classic brick exterior and a dedicated porch or balcony for each of its eight units, each of which looks out on a sizable communal grass yard. Many units feature hardwood floors. Woodland is aptly named, as it’s located in a wooded residential neighborhood; a small greenbelt sits just two houses east.Despite its woodsy neighborhood, this multi-family property sports easy access to the greater Cleveland area. Tenants are never more than a few minutes from downtown Cleveland, with all the amenities that includes. $55,000 will be invested in renovations for Woodland, as we believe rents are significantly below market for the area. Once renovations are completed, we anticipate an improvement in rental income for our investors.',
